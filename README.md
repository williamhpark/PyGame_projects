# PyGame_projects

When I first decided to learn Python, creating these games using the PyGame module was my way of getting introduced to the language!
There is definitely room for improvement in terms of the code's efficiency and the gameplay is quite rudimentary, but learning to create a GUI in Python
and create programs that I can play/interact with was a great experience.
